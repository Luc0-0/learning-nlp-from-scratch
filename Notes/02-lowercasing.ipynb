    "# 📌 Topic: Text Normalization - Lowercasing\n",

    "### What you will learn\n",
    "- Why lowercasing is important in NLP\n",
    "- How to convert text to lowercase in Python\n",
    "- When lowercasing helps and when it hurts\n",
    "- Batch processing multiple texts efficiently\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why this matters\n",
    "Text normalization is the second critical step in NLP pipelines. Lowercasing specifically treats \"Luna\" and \"luna\" as the same word, reducing vocabulary size and improving model performance. However, it's not always the right choice—sometimes capitalization matters (e.g., detecting proper nouns, acronyms).\n",

    "## What is Text Normalization?\n",
    "\n",
    "**Text normalization** is the process of converting text into a standard, consistent format. The most common normalization technique is **lowercasing** — converting all characters to lowercase.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why lowercase?\n",
    "- **Reduces vocabulary**: \"Luna\", \"LUNA\", and \"luna\" are treated as the same word\n",
    "- **Improves model training**: Models see more examples of each word (better statistics)\n",
    "- **Simplifies matching**: Easier to find words regardless of capitalization\n",
    "\n",
    "### When NOT to lowercase:\n",
    "- **Named Entity Recognition (NER)**: You need capital letters to identify proper nouns\n",
    "- **Acronyms**: \"NASA\" vs \"nasa\" have different meanings\n",
    "- **Sentiment analysis**: Some capitalization conveys emotion (\"AMAZING\" vs \"amazing\")\n",
    "\n",
    "### Rule of thumb:\n",
    "Lowercase for **vocabulary reduction tasks** (word counting, text classification), but preserve case for **entity detection** or **emotion analysis**."

    "sentence = sentence.lower()  # Assign the result back\n",
    "```\n",

    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### ❌ Mistake 2: Losing information unnecessarily\n",
    "If you're doing Named Entity Recognition (NER) or detecting proper nouns, **never** lowercase first.\n",
    "```python\n",
    "\"Steve Jobs\" → \"steve jobs\"  # Now you can't tell it's a person's name\n",
    "```\n",

    "### ✅ Solution:\n",
    "For NER tasks, preserve case and normalize differently (remove punctuation, etc.).\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### ❌ Mistake 3: Applying lowercasing to the wrong input\n",
    "If you're using a pre-trained model that expects lowercased input, **must** lowercase before feeding it.\n",
    "\n",
    "### ✅ Solution:\n",
    "Check your model's documentation—if it was trained on lowercased text, preprocess similarly."

    "## Key Takeaways\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Lowercasing reduces vocabulary**: Same word, different cases = 1 word after lowercasing\n",
    "2. **Use list comprehensions** for batch processing: Concise and efficient\n",
    "3. **Know when NOT to lowercase**: NER, acronym detection, sentiment analysis\n",

    "5. **Check your model**: Different models expect different preprocessing\n",

    "## Practice:\n",
    "- Try lowercasing text with emails or URLs — what happens?\n",
    "- Experiment with uppercase text in sentiment analysis — does it change results?\n",

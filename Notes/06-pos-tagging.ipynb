    "POS tagging automatically identifies the grammatical role of each word (noun, verb, adjective, etc.). This is essential for many NLP tasks: dependency parsing, named entity recognition, sentiment analysis, and grammar checking. spaCy makes this easy with pre-trained models that achieve 97%+ accuracy on English text.\n",

    "## What are POS Tags?\n",
    "\n",
    "**Part-of-speech (POS) tags** label each word with its grammatical role in context.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Example:\n",
    "```\n",
    "\"The cat sleeps peacefully\"\n",
    " |   |    |      |  \n",
    " DET NOUN VERB   ADV\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Common POS Tags:\n",
    "\n",
    "| Tag | Meaning | Examples |\n",
    "|-----|---------|----------|\n",
    "| **NOUN** | Noun | cat, dog, house, intelligence |\n",
    "| **VERB** | Verb | sleep, eat, run, think |\n",
    "| **ADJ** | Adjective | happy, red, intelligent |\n",
    "| **ADV** | Adverb | quickly, very, peacefully |\n",
    "| **PROPN** | Proper Noun | Emma, London, Google |\n",
    "| **PRON** | Pronoun | I, he, she, it, they |\n",
    "| **DET** | Determiner | the, a, an, this, that |\n",
    "| **ADP** | Adposition (preposition) | in, on, at, from |\n",
    "| **AUX** | Auxiliary Verb | is, was, have, will |\n",
    "| **CCONJ** | Coordinating Conjunction | and, or, but |\n",
    "| **SCONJ** | Subordinating Conjunction | because, if, while |\n",
    "| **INTJ** | Interjection | wow, oops, hello |\n",
    "| **NUM** | Number | 1, two, 3.14 |\n",
    "| **PART** | Particle | 's, not, -ing (suffix) |\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why POS tags matter:\n",
    "1. **Disambiguate meaning**: \"bank\" (NOUN) vs. \"bank\" (VERB) vs. \"bank\" (ADP in \"bank on\")\n",
    "2. **Enable syntax analysis**: Build parse trees, identify sentence structure\n",
    "3. **Improve downstream tasks**: NER, sentiment analysis, lemmatization all benefit from POS\n",
    "4. **Grammar checking**: Detect grammatical errors based on POS sequences\n",
    "5. **Information extraction**: Find nouns for entity names, verbs for actions"

    "## Practical Applications of POS Tagging\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. **Named Entity Recognition (NER)**\n",
    "Proper nouns (PROPN) often indicate people, places, organizations.\n",
    "```python\n",
    "if token.pos_ == \"PROPN\":\n",
    "    # Likely an entity, do further analysis\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. **Information Extraction**\n",
    "Extract subject-verb-object patterns:\n",
    "```\n",
    "NOUN(subject) + VERB + NOUN(object)\n",
    "Example: \"Emma loved books\" → Extract fact about Emma\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. **Sentiment Analysis**\n",
    "Focus on adjectives and adverbs:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "if token.pos_ in [\"ADJ\", \"ADV\"]:\n",
    "    # Check if word is positive/negative\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4. **Grammar Checking**\n",
    "Detect grammatical errors:\n",
    "```\n",
    "NOUN + NOUN + VERB → Usually incorrect (should be adj between)\n",
    "\"blue house is\" → Check if \"blue\" is actually ADJ\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### 5. **Lemmatization Improvement**\n",
    "POS tags help lemmatizers disambiguate:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# \"better\" is ambiguous without context\n",
    "lemmatizer.lemmatize(\"better\", pos=\"ADJ\")  # → \"good\"\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### 6. **Machine Translation**\n",
    "Target language needs correct POS structure:\n",
    "```\n",
    "English: \"big red house\" (ADJ ADJ NOUN)\n",
    "French: \"maison grande rouge\" (NOUN ADJ ADJ) ← different order!\n",
    "```"

   "source": [
    "## Common Beginner Mistakes\n",
    "\n",
    "### ❌ Mistake 1: Assuming word form determines POS\n",
    "```python\n",
    "\"The bank is running\" vs. \"The bank of the river\"\n",
    "# 'bank' looks like a noun but first example has VERB 'is running' after it\n",
    "# Wrong: Always treating 'bank' as NOUN\n",
    "# Right: Let the model determine POS from context\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### ❌ Mistake 2: Using POS tags without understanding context\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Just because something is marked VERB doesn't mean it's an action\n",
    "# \"seems\" is a verb but expresses a state, not an action\n",
    "# \"The data seems to show\" ← 'seems' is important for sentiment\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### ❌ Mistake 3: Expecting 100% accuracy\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Even spaCy gets ~97% accuracy\n",
    "# \"The bear walked to the bank\" ← may tag wrong without context\n",
    "# Design systems that tolerate occasional errors\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### ✅ Best practices:\n",
    "- Always use POS tags, not just word forms\n",
    "- Understand that POS is context-dependent\n",
    "- Design error-tolerant systems\n",
    "- Combine with other signals (lemma, entity type, etc.)"

    "## Key Takeaways\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **POS tags identify grammar roles**: NOUN, VERB, ADJ, ADV, etc.\n",
    "2. **Context matters**: Same word can have different POS (\"bank\" as NOUN vs. VERB)\n",
    "3. **spaCy makes it easy**: Pre-trained models with 97%+ accuracy\n",
    "4. **Function words dominate frequency**: Stop words appear most often\n",
    "5. **Content words matter more**: Nouns/verbs/adjectives carry meaning\n",

    "7. **Pandas makes analysis easy**: Group, filter, and visualize POS data\n",

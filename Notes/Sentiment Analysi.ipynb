    "### What you will learn\n",
    "- What sentiment analysis is and how it works\n",
    "- Two approaches: lexicon-based (TextBlob, VADER) vs. neural (transformers)\n",
    "- Polarity (positive/negative) and subjectivity (opinion/fact)\n",
    "- Handling negations and complex sentence structures\n",
    "- When sentiment analysis works well and when it fails\n",
    "- Practical applications in customer feedback, social media monitoring\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why this matters\n",
    "Sentiment analysis automatically detects opinions and emotions in text. It powers review aggregation, brand monitoring, customer service automation, and social media insights. Understanding sentiment is crucial for any business analyzing customer feedback.\n",

    "## What is Sentiment Analysis?\n",
    "\n",
    "**Sentiment Analysis** is the task of determining the emotional tone or opinion expressed in text.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Example:\n",
    "```\n",
    "\"I loved the movie! The acting was fantastic.\" → Positive\n",
    "\"The movie was okay, but the plot was confusing.\" → Negative\n",
    "\"The movie will be released next Tuesday.\" → Neutral (fact, no opinion)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Two dimensions:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Polarity**: Is the opinion positive or negative?\n",
    "   - Range: -1.0 (very negative) to +1.0 (very positive)\n",
    "   - 0.0 = neutral\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Subjectivity**: Is this an opinion or a fact?\n",
    "   - Range: 0.0 (objective fact) to 1.0 (subjective opinion)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Real-world applications:\n",
    "1. **Customer Reviews**: Amazon determines 5-star rating from text\n",
    "2. **Brand Monitoring**: Track what people think about your company online\n",
    "3. **Social Media**: Detect trending negative sentiment for crisis management\n",
    "4. **Customer Service**: Route angry customers to senior agents\n",
    "5. **Market Research**: Understand customer satisfaction from feedback\n",
    "6. **Content Recommendation**: Show users content they'll enjoy based on sentiment\n",
    "\n",
    "### Challenges:\n",
    "- **Sarcasm**: \"Oh great, another delayed flight\" (negative, but sounds positive)\n",
    "- **Negation**: \"I didn't hate it\" (double negative = positive?)\n",
    "- **Context**: \"The weather is killing me\" (negative context, but literally positive)\n",
    "- **Domain-specific**: \"bold design\" is positive for fashion, negative for medicine"

    "## Best Practices for Sentiment Analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "### ✅ Do:\n",
    "1. **Preprocess text**: Remove URLs, normalize contractions (\"don't\" → \"do not\")\n",
    "2. **Understand your data**: What sentiment patterns appear?\n",
    "3. **Set appropriate thresholds**: Don't use -0.05 to 0.05 as neutral if your data is mostly objective\n",
    "4. **Combine signals**: Use sentiment + entity information for better insights\n",
    "5. **Manual validation**: Spot-check results on sample data\n",
    "6. **Handle domain-specific**: Train custom models for specialized text\n",
    "\n",
    "### ❌ Don't:\n",
    "1. **Assume 100% accuracy**: Sentiment analysis makes mistakes\n",
    "2. **Use a single score**: Combine polarity + subjectivity + confidence\n",
    "3. **Ignore context**: \"I love how complicated this is\" (sarcasm)\n",
    "4. **Apply blindly**: Test on your actual data first\n",
    "5. **Treat as facts**: Sentiment scores are probabilities, not ground truth\n",
    "\n",
    "### When to use lexicon-based (TextBlob/VADER):\n",
    "- Quick prototyping and exploration\n",
    "- Real-time analysis (social media monitoring)\n",
    "- Limited computational resources\n",
    "\n",

    "   - Machine learning (accurate, complex, opaque) ← Use for production\n",
    "3. **TextBlob is easy**: Good starting point for learning\n",

    "\n",
    "### What you will learn\n",
    "1. **NER fundamentals** - What entities are and why they matter\n",
    "2. **Entity types** - PERSON, ORG, DATE, NORP, GPE, MONEY, PERCENT, and more\n",
    "3. **How NER models work** - Neural networks trained on annotated corpora\n",
    "4. **Extraction workflows** - Finding, classifying, and structuring entities\n",
    "5. **Visualization techniques** - Using spaCy's displacy to see extractions\n",
    "6. **Model limitations** - When and why NER fails on real text\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why this matters\n",
    "NER is the foundation for:\n",
    "- **Knowledge graphs**: Connecting people to organizations to locations\n",
    "- **Information extraction**: Populating databases from documents\n",
    "- **Question answering**: Understanding what questions are asking about\n",
    "- **Content search**: Finding articles about specific people/companies\n",
    "- **Content moderation**: Detecting sensitive information to redact\n",
    "- **Recommendation**: Linking articles via shared entities\n",
    "\n",
    "### Real-world context\n",
    "When you search for news about a person and get all relevant articles, that's NER. When a knowledge base knows that Apple Inc. and Steve Jobs are related, that came from NER. Understanding how NER works enables building these systems.\n",

    "## What is Named Entity Recognition (NER)?\n",
    "\n",
    "**Named Entity Recognition** is the task of identifying and classifying named entities (proper nouns) in text.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Example:\n",
    "```\n",
    "Text: \"Google was founded on September 4, 1998, by Larry Page and Sergey Brin.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "Entities found:\n",
    "- Google → ORG (Organization)\n",
    "- September 4, 1998 → DATE\n",
    "- Larry Page → PERSON\n",
    "- Sergey Brin → PERSON\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why NER matters:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Information Extraction**: Find key entities to populate databases\n",
    "2. **Knowledge Graphs**: Build networks of entities and relationships\n",
    "3. **Question Answering**: \"Who is the CEO of Google?\" → Find PERSON associated with Google\n",
    "4. **Text Understanding**: Identify what the text is about\n",
    "5. **Recommendation Systems**: Recommend content about extracted entities\n",
    "6. **Content Moderation**: Detect sensitive information (names, locations)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Common Entity Types:\n",
    "\n",
    "| Tag | Meaning | Examples |\n",
    "|-----|---------|----------|\n",
    "| **PERSON** | Person names | John Smith, Emma, Barack Obama |\n",
    "| **ORG** | Organization names | Google, Apple, MIT |\n",
    "| **GPE** | Geo-political entity (country, city) | France, New York, Beijing |\n",
    "| **NORP** | Nationality, religion, political group | American, Christian, Democrat |\n",
    "| **DATE** | Dates and time periods | September 4, 1998, Tuesday |\n",
    "| **TIME** | Times | 3 PM, noon, midnight |\n",
    "| **MONEY** | Monetary values | $5 million, €100 |\n",
    "| **PERCENT** | Percentages | 50%, about 1/3 |\n",
    "| **FACILITY** | Buildings, airports, landmarks | Empire State Building, JFK Airport |\n",
    "| **PRODUCT** | Named products | iPhone, Windows 10 |\n",
    "| **EVENT** | Named events | World War II, Thanksgiving |\n",
    "| **LAW** | Named documents | Magna Carta, Affordable Care Act |\n",
    "| **LANGUAGE** | Language names | English, Mandarin |\n",

    "Text: \"He went to New York and then to Germany\"\n",
    "Issue: Both are places, but:\n",
    "- \"New York\" might be tagged as CITY, GPE, or LOCATION\n",
    "- \"Germany\" might be tagged as COUNTRY or GPE\n",
    "The model was trained on NEWS, so it prefers GPE\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### ❌ **Problem 3: Domain mismatch**\n",
    "```\n",
    "News domain: \"Barack Obama visited Israel\"\n",
    "Model works great (trained on news)\n",
    "\n",
    "Medical domain: \"Patient took aspirin after diagnosis\"\n",
    "Issue: \"aspirin\" should be MEDICINE, but model doesn't know this entity type\n",
    "Solution: Train custom NER for your domain\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### ❌ **Problem 4: Case sensitivity**\n",
    "```\n",
    "\"john smith\" vs. \"John Smith\"\n",
    "Lowercase version is harder to recognize as PERSON\n",
    "NER relies on capitalization cues\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### ❌ **Problem 5: Context-dependent entities**\n",
    "```\n",
    "\"Apple is a fruit\" → 'fruit' type, not ORG\n",
    "\"I use Apple products\" → ORG\n",
    "Context matters, and models sometimes get confused\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### ✅ **How to handle limitations:**\n",
    "1. **Evaluate on your data**: F1 score might be 90% in general, but only 70% on your text type\n",
    "2. **Post-processing rules**: Fix known errors with regex or domain knowledge\n",
    "3. **Custom training**: Fine-tune models on domain-specific annotated data\n",

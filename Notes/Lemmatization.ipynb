    "# 📌 Topic: Lemmatization\n",
    "\n",
    "### What you will learn\n",
    "- What lemmatization is and how it differs from stemming\n",
    "- How the WordNet Lemmatizer works\n",
    "- When to use lemmatization vs. stemming\n",
    "- Practical applications: accuracy over speed\n",
    "- How lemmatization preserves word meaning\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why this matters\n",
    "Lemmatization is the **smarter, slower cousin of stemming**. Instead of blindly stripping suffixes, it uses a dictionary (WordNet) to find the actual root word (lemma). While slower, it produces real English words and preserves semantic meaning, making it essential for accurate NLP tasks like sentiment analysis, NER, and question answering.\n",

    "## What is Lemmatization?\n",
    "\n",
    "**Lemmatization** is the process of reducing words to their base form (called the **lemma**) using morphological analysis and a dictionary.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Example:\n",
    "- \"connecting\", \"connected\", \"connects\" → \"connect\"\n",
    "- \"better\" → \"good\" (not \"better\"!)\n",
    "- \"was\", \"is\", \"are\" → \"be\"\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key differences from stemming:\n",
    "\n",
    "| Feature | Stemming | Lemmatization |\n",
    "|---------|----------|----------------|\n",
    "| **Approach** | Rule-based suffix stripping | Dictionary lookup |\n",
    "| **Speed** | ⚡ Fast | 🐢 Slow |\n",
    "| **Output** | May be non-words | Always real words |\n",
    "| **Accuracy** | Lower | ✅ Higher |\n",
    "| **\"better\"** | \"better\" | \"good\" |\n",
    "| **\"was\"** | \"wa\" (non-word) | \"be\" |\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why choose lemmatization?\n",
    "1. **Semantically correct**: \"better\" actually means \"good in comparative form\"\n",
    "2. **Real words only**: No garbage like \"poni\" or \"wa\"\n",
    "3. **Better for downstream tasks**: NER, sentiment analysis benefit from accurate lemmas\n",
    "4. **Improves interpretability**: You're working with actual English words"

    "\n",
    "### ✅ Good use cases:\n",
    "1. **Sentiment Analysis**: \"better\" → \"good\" preserves semantic meaning\n",
    "2. **Named Entity Recognition**: Helps identify base forms in context\n",
    "3. **Information Extraction**: Accurate base forms for database storage\n",
    "4. **Small to medium datasets**: When accuracy matters more than speed\n",
    "5. **Text analysis tools**: Tools where interpretability is important\n",
    "\n",
    "### ❌ When NOT to use:\n",
    "1. **Billions of documents**: Too slow (lemmatization is 10-100x slower than stemming)\n",
    "2. **Real-time applications**: API responses need < 100ms latency\n",
    "3. **Modern neural networks**: Transformers learn morphology themselves (no need to lemmatize)\n",
    "4. **Character-level models**: They work at sub-word level\n",
    "\n",
    "### Rule of thumb:\n",
    "**Use lemmatization for accuracy-critical NLP tasks.** Use stemming for speed-critical applications."

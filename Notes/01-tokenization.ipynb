    "\n",
    "### What you will learn\n",
    "- What tokenization is and why it's fundamental to NLP\n",
    "- How to split text into sentences (sentence tokenization)\n",
    "- How to split text into individual words (word tokenization)\n",
    "- Common edge cases (contractions, punctuation, possessives)\n",
    "- Hands-on examples with real text\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why this matters\n",
    "Tokenization is the **first and most critical step** in almost every NLP pipeline. Before you can analyze text, you must break it down into meaningful units. Most downstream tasks (sentiment analysis, NER, machine translation, etc.) depend entirely on quality tokenization.\n",

    "## What is Tokenization?\n",
    "\n",
    "**Tokenization** is the process of splitting raw text into smaller, meaningful units called **tokens**. Tokens are usually words or sentences, but can be characters or subword units depending on your use case.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Example:\n",
    "- Input: `\"Her cat's name is Luna.\"`\n",
    "- Tokens: `['Her', 'cat', \"'s\", 'name', 'is', 'Luna', '.']`\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why tokenize?\n",
    "- Computers process discrete units, not continuous streams\n",
    "- Enables counting word frequencies, building vocabularies, and creating features\n",
    "- Necessary for sentence-level analysis (sentiment per sentence, etc.)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Trade-off**: Simple splitting (e.g., on spaces) doesn't handle punctuation, contractions, or other edge cases well. NLTK's tokenizers use trained models to handle these intelligently."

    "## Step 2: Sentence Tokenization\n",
    "\n",
    "The first level of tokenization is **sentence splitting**. The `sent_tokenize()` function identifies sentence boundaries (typically marked by `.`, `!`, or `?`).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why sentence tokenization first?\n",
    "- Sentences are often the relevant unit for analysis (e.g., sentiment per sentence)\n",
    "- Many NLP models process one sentence at a time\n",
    "- Helps avoid errors: word from one sentence shouldn't be confused with context from another\n",
    "\n",
    "### How it works:\n",
    "NLTK's `sent_tokenize()` uses a trained neural network that learned patterns of sentence endings. It handles edge cases like abbreviations (e.g., \"Dr. Smith\") better than naive period-splitting."

    "\n",
    "1. **Separate punctuation** from words (e.g., \"Luna.\" → \"Luna\", \".\")\n",
    "2. **Handle contractions** intelligently (e.g., \"don't\" → \"do\", \"n't\")\n",
    "3. **Respect possessives** (e.g., \"cat's\" → \"cat\", \"'s\")\n",

    "3. **Use pre-trained models**: NLTK's tokenizers are better than naive string splitting because they handle edge cases\n",
    "4. **Punctuation matters**: It gets separated from words, which is useful for downstream processing\n",
    "5. **Understand your tokenizer's behavior**: Different systems split contractions/possessives differently\n",
    "\n",
    "## Next steps:\n",
    "- Try tokenizing text with contractions like \"don't\", \"can't\", \"it's\"\n",
    "- Compare results from NLTK with simple `.split()` to see the difference\n",
